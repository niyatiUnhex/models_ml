# models_ml
I have attached one ML (Classification Model) project of mine in this repo after performing an online survey on "Products which we prefer buy ".
Depending on the data, this model derives that what classes (mode of interest) for a mass of people are likely to buy. By this model we get to know about preferences of people.
